This is kind of cool, they have a Domain knowledge Network where they do this.

"We generate topical maps based on your business info to build authority.

Each node becomes a suggested page with titles, categories, and keywords. You can edit details, then generate articles directly in Content Genius. The SEO benefits come from interconnected pages that strengthen your sites topical relevance."

So does this mean we should add a sort of hidden blog page with different categories? I am confused.

Like are they saying to create pages of blog posts just to increase SEO word searches ?









lets do it,maybe we can hide all the pages in a footer? I will start generating stuff with their tool.


Here is first page : 

Parlay Calculator Category
The article is the html file.

This will also have 10 sub pages.
- How Accurate is the Parlay Calculator?
- Beginner's Guide to Using a Parlay Calculator
- Using a Parlay Calculator with Odds Boosts
- Parlay Calculator for Other Sports
- Using a Parlay Calculator for Live NFL Betting
- Using a Parlay Calculator with Teaser Bets
- Using a Parlay Calculator with Round Robin Bets
- Using a Parlay Calculator with Same Game Parlays
- Using a Parlay Calculator with Alternate Lines
- Using a Parlay Calculator with Futures Bets













Okay I want to work on redesigning the player page to make it less AI looking. to start, I want to make the page color a gradient of their team colors.




Good evening, I would like to work on the UI of the player page in local hose. I designed a mobile version of how I would like the UI to look in figma and took an image of it so you can see. of course it will also have to be compatable with other sizes like desktop as we have already been doing. Can you please replecate this image for our players page?



Alright you did a good job. A few edits to make.

- The blue box that says buildparlays at the top was suppost to be the header so you could identify it. dont need to add another so can remove that.

- green circle is suppost to be aligned next to the player name. This is the identifier if a player is active, questionable, or out.

- that small imiage icon is going ot be the logo of the team they play for. then the user can click on it and it will direct them to the teams page.

- big circle image is going ot be the players picture so users can see what they look like.

- you did an awesome job with the sliders and stuff but we need to make sure the padding matches the padding of the season stats box so that they all look alligned clean and perfectly the same sizing.

- we need to make sure the drag bars are actually draggable and slideable. 











Awesone thank you for removing all that, I have decided for my current site there is no point in using an api when games only happoen a few times a week. I am making calls to data that is not getting updated continuosly. makes no sense. Instead I would like to have my own databse so i can have info for my users faster and less costly. 

i found out about something called NFLverse, a comprehensive nfl data repository on github. supposedly it inlcudes player stats (summary by game/season, e.g., yards, TD's. efficency metrics), team stats (standings, summaries), game schedules and results, weekly rosters (player positions, teams), injuries, trades, and more. Not only is the current season actively included but also some historical data all the way back to 1999. They have formats CSV (for things like trades and teams), Parquet (efficient for large datasets), RDS (R format, but convertible), and others. 

I would like to use this as the db for my site, we will be able to have everything on hand and then after each game I can just manually re download or update the db with the new latest data.  Can you help me set this up?











Alright now that we have our own data and real data, lets go back to working on the player page and the calculator. We only want to focus on current year data. So it's currently 2025. we want all of the players 2025 data 














Okay before we start wowking on the calculator now we still have a few more bigs that need to be ironed out

- The search icon is not in the search bar, its like in the complete wrong position. 

- on mobile when I click the hamhurger menu the search icon in the search bar is out of alignment as well.

- when I currently write inside the search bar i cant see the text I am writing, its just white or empty so not sure whats happening but cant see.

- That nflverse data we are using they have a requirement that they are credited if useing their product for yours. So maybe we can give them credit in our footer?










alright, I want to update github with what we have as of now. However I think we first need to make sure it works with vercel right? I am looking at vercel project dashboard right now and create a database has the following options.

- edge config
- blob

Marketplace database providers
- neon
- upstash
- supabase
- redis 
- nile
- motherduck
-prisma postgres
- turso
- gel
- mongodb atlas

Will any of these work for us or do we need to set something up or what?\. I have no idea so what is the best thing for us to make sure it works online?

Okay so in vercel i removed the turso itegration to make sure it wasnt affecting the environment variables or contradicting them. Then I realized the variables never saved so I re added them and re deployed. now the deploy was succesful but there was this error that appeared in the build log. 

Error getting players: B [Error]: Dynamic server usage: Route /api/database/players couldn't be rendered statically because it used `request.url`. See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/dynamic-server-error

}







we are still having errors. Are you able to install or access vercel in terminal so you can see all the errors and issues yourself?



Awesome now i would like to work in local host. But I want it to work with our server so That I know the changes we are making will function it's just not deployed. is that possible or do we need to keep using a local db setup?




okay yes you got the local host to be the same as the live site. now I am currently seeing the following issues.


- When click on this weeks top parlay players, they all direct to patrick mahomes.

- the back button on pages all direct back to mock data chiefs team page. not back to prior page.

- when click on a top nfl team it doesnt bring me to their teams page it brings to chiefs team mock data page as well. so a lot of pages are being brought to or back to mock data pages and not the actual pages.
















Awesome, thank you! Okay now we can finally start working on stuff. First.

Remember how we have the thing that pops up if there is a game today? I love that, but it only appears if there is a game that day. Would it be possible to also have one that does the exact same thing but for "Upcoming Games"? So for example today is wednesday. Can we make it so it also Identifies that tomorrow there is a Thursday night game and it show the upcoming next games? but only for one day. So if its wednesday I want it to only show the thursday game, I dont want it to also show the sunday games. if working correctly when page loads and theres no games that day It should show the vikings vs chargers game for tomorrow night. Oh also, when sunday games are the games that appear for upcoming games, I would like if we can have them in order by time. that way it's always showing the next closest games first and like doesnt have the night game displayed as the first one. So on top of all that we should make sure that its a side scrolling menu cause then in the event there are multiple games its like all in one spot you slide or drag and not taking up large portions of the page.










Hmm. Well then why dont we do this. ESPN allows to make api calls right? let's just make a call right now to get the full NFL Schedule for the year, make a new db thing called 2025_season_sechedule then save the schedule to that so we have our own hardcopy. then we can add that to our turso DB as well. Then boom we have the entire years schedule and never need to worry abt it again?









okay its showing now but it doesnt show the thursday game for tomorrow. It just shows the 12 sunday games. Also, how comes there is so much empty space between them here?



actually here, I got a pdf file  with every week of the of the 2025 nfl schedule with every week. it has the teams playing, where its at (this tells us who is home team), day, time, and brodcaster. so you can put it into a db form then upload it to the turso. that work?




Okay here, I just got you the season schedule myself.
