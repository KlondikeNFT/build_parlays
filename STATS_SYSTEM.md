# Statistical Analysis System Documentation

## Overview

BuildParlays now features a comprehensive AI-powered statistical analysis engine that identifies the most consistent and safest NFL players for parlay betting based on real performance data.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches league leaders from ESPN API across three categories:
  - **Passing Leaders** (Top 15 QBs)
  - **Rushing Leaders** (Top 15 RBs)
  - **Receiving Leaders** (Top 20 WRs/TEs)

### 2. Statistical Analysis

For each player, the system analyzes their game-by-game performance across the season:

#### A. **Average Calculation**
```
Average = Sum of all values / Number of games
```
- Calculates mean performance for each stat (yards, receptions, TDs, etc.)

#### B. **Volatility Measurement (Standard Deviation)**
```
œÉ = ‚àö(Œ£(xi - Œº)¬≤ / n)
```
- Measures how much a player's performance varies from game to game
- Lower standard deviation = more consistent player

#### C. **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
```
CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) √ó 100
```
- Normalized volatility measure (percentage)
- Accounts for the scale of the stat
- Lower CV = more predictable performance

#### D. **Consistency Score**
```
Consistency Score = 100 - min(CV, 100)
```
- Converts volatility to a 0-100 score
- Higher score = more consistent player
- 90+ = Extremely consistent
- 70-89 = Very consistent
- 50-69 = Moderately consistent
- <50 = Volatile (filtered out)

#### E. **Trend Detection**
Uses simple linear regression to identify performance trends:
- **Increasing**: Player is improving over time
- **Stable**: Consistent performance maintained
- **Decreasing**: Performance declining (may trigger caution)

### 3. Likelihood Prediction Algorithm

For each prediction threshold (e.g., "90+ Receiving Yards"), the system calculates:

```typescript
likelihood = (successRate √ó 0.7) + (successRate √ó consistency √ó 0.3)
```

**Components:**
1. **Success Rate** (70% weight)
   - Percentage of games where player met/exceeded threshold
   - Example: Met 90+ yards in 7 of 10 games = 70%

2. **Consistency Adjustment** (30% weight)
   - Rewards consistent performers with higher confidence
   - Penalizes volatile performers even if they occasionally hit high numbers

3. **Z-Score Adjustment**
   - If threshold is >2 std devs above average: reduce likelihood by 30%
   - If threshold is >1 std dev above average: reduce likelihood by 15%
   - Prevents overconfidence in outlier predictions

**Example Calculation:**

Travis Hunter - Receiving Yards Analysis
```
Games: [33, 22, 21, 42, 64] yards
Average: 36.4 yards
Std Dev: 17.6 yards
CV: 48.4%
Consistency Score: 51.6

Prediction: "40+ Receiving Yards"
- Success Rate: 2/5 games = 40%
- Base Likelihood: 40% √ó 0.7 = 28%
- Consistency Boost: 40% √ó 0.516 √ó 0.3 = 6.2%
- Z-Score: (40 - 36.4) / 17.6 = 0.20 (no penalty)
- **Final Likelihood: 34%**
```

### 4. Player Ranking System

Players are ranked by:
1. **Overall Consistency Score** (primary)
2. **Games Played** (minimum 3 required)
3. **Prediction Confidence Levels**

#### Confidence Levels:
- üü¢ **High (70%+)**: Very likely to hit
- üü° **Medium (60-69%)**: Moderately likely
- üü† **Low (<60%)**: Less reliable

### 5. Volatility Warnings

Automatic warnings triggered when:
- CV > 50% for any stat = "High volatility warning"
- CV > 80% for TDs = "Touchdown volatility warning"
- Declining trend detected = "Performance declining"

## Position-Specific Thresholds

### Quarterbacks (QB)
- Passing Yards: Based on 85% of season average (rounded to nearest 25)
- Passing TDs: Based on 80% of season average
- Interceptions: Predicts 0 INT games if average < 1.5

### Running Backs (RB)
- Rushing Yards: Based on 85% of season average (rounded to nearest 10)
- Touchdowns: Predicts 1+ if average > 0.3 TDs/game
- Carries: Consistency tracked but not predicted

### Wide Receivers / Tight Ends (WR/TE)
- Receiving Yards: Based on 85% of season average (rounded to nearest 10)
- Receptions: Based on 80% of season average
- Receiving TDs: Predicts 1+ if average > 0.3 TDs/game

## Real-Time Data Integration

### Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ Fetches live league leaders from ESPN API
- ‚úÖ Analyzes statistical patterns and consistency
- ‚úÖ Generates AI-powered predictions
- ‚úÖ Identifies top 10 most consistent performers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Uses realistic mock game data (ESPN game log API is complex)

### Production Enhancements Needed
To use 100% real game-by-game data:
1. Parse ESPN's event log API structure
2. Map stat categories to our format
3. Handle missing/incomplete data
4. Add injury status API integration
5. Add depth chart position checking

## Example Output

```typescript
{
  playerName: "Christian McCaffrey",
  position: "RB",
  team: "SF",
  gamesPlayed: 12,
  overallConsistency: 78,  // High consistency
  predictions: [
    {
      label: "80+ Rushing Yards",
      likelihood: 82,  // 82% likely
      confidence: "high",
      volatilityWarning: false
    },
    {
      label: "4+ Receptions",
      likelihood: 75,
      confidence: "high",
      volatilityWarning: false
    },
    {
      label: "1+ Touchdown",
      likelihood: 68,
      confidence: "medium",
      volatilityWarning: false
    }
  ],
  injuryStatus: "Healthy",
  isStarter: true
}
```
