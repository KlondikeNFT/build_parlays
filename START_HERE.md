## 🔑 Your API Key:

Configured in `next.config.js`:
```
69641481ea3e47728270d996b5132104
```

**Trial Limits:**
- ~1,000 requests/month
- Perfect for development
- Upgrade when ready for production

## 📁 What Was Built:

### New Files:
1. **`lib/sportsdataio.ts`** - SportsDataIO API client
2. **`lib/realPlayerService.ts`** - Real data service with AI analysis

### Updated:
- `next.config.js` - API key configuration
- `app/page.tsx` - Uses SportsDataIO instead of ESPN

### Removed (Complex/Broken):
- ~~lib/database.ts~~ - No longer needed
- ~~lib/syncService.ts~~ - No longer needed  
- ~~app/api/sync~~  - No longer needed
- ~~app/admin~~ - No longer needed

## 🎨 How It Works:

7. DONE! (2-5 seconds with REAL data)
```

## 🚀 Test It Now:

1. **Stop your current server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)

2. **Restart:**
```bash
cd /Users/klondike/Desktop/build-parlays
npm run dev
```

3. **Visit:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Look for:**
- Real player names
- Actual statistics
- Correct team assignments
- Real photos

## 💡 What You Can Do Next:

### Add More Features:
```typescript
// Get injuries for a player
const injuries = await sportsdataApi.getInjuries();

// Get depth chart
const depthChart = await sportsdataApi.getDepthChart('KC');

// Get game-by-game stats
const gameStats = await sportsdataApi.getPlayerGameStats('2024', '6');
```

### Display on Pages:
- Show injury status on player cards
- Display depth chart position
- Show game-by-game performance charts
- Add historical trends

## 📈 Optimization Tips:

### For Production:
1. **Cache SportsDataIO responses** (1 hour)
2. **Use database** to store processed data
3. **Update after games** (not on every page load)
4. **Implement rate limiting**

### Code Example:
```typescript
// Add simple caching
const CACHE_TIME = 3600000; // 1 hour
let cachedPlayers = null;
let cacheTime = 0;

if (Date.now() - cacheTime < CACHE_TIME && cachedPlayers) {
  return cachedPlayers; // Use cache
}

// Fetch fresh
cachedPlayers = await fetchFromSportsData();
cacheTime = Date.now();
```

## 🎯 Endpoints You Can Use:

```typescript

// Roster
