I want to build a website called "BuildParlays" that is dedicated to showing player stats and outcome likelyhoods to help people find the safest and best likely outcomes to place in their parlays. Currently I want it only NFL based. There should be option to view all nfl teams, view team data and individual player data. basically a website for all team and player stats of the nfl, similar to nfl or espn and other data platforms. Not worried about parlay or likleyhood information yet. just getting a working landing page and real data.

Some Landing page items:
1. teams (menu of all teams)
2. Schedule (calander of all nfl games and times and brodcast locations)
3. Search bar (to search specific players, teams, etc.)






Alright I love it so far. I would like to make some changes. Maybe we can say that it's AI since ai is a trending niche rn. even if its not, we can call it something like an AI Sports calculator or something. It would also be massive I think if make it say something like "BuildParlays has no affiliation with any casino or sports book organizations". that could build lots of trust since people claim many times things are rigged.


Then I would like to remove those large three buttons below the blue that says All teams, schedule, and search. I want to replace that section with a side scrolling menu that says this weeks top players. then in the menu is cards of players from the leagues top players. It should take the ones from the list with the safest average, like no mossing games, and stats with least volitility, then put their safest info in a card like

- Player image
- Player name
- 90+ receiving yards - 60% likely 
- 4+ receptions - 80% likely
etc. 







Yes! that is exactly what i was looking for! Only now we need to build an actual function that calculates those stats and identifies players from the real latest and current data.

It will have to,

- find players leading in stats on rankings.
- identify stat types.
- analyze numbers accross all games of season. 
so for example lets say we have player Travis Hunter. here is just their receiving stats for this season

Game 1:
- Receptions: 6
- Targets: 8
- Yards: 33
- AVG: 5.5
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 10
- Receiving First Downs: 0

Game 2:
- Receptions: 3
- Targets: 6
- Yards: 22
- AVG: 7.3
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 9
- Receiving First Downs: 1

Game 3:
- Receptions: 1
- Targets: 2
- Yards: 21
- AVG: 21.0
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 21
- Receiving First Downs: 1

Game 4:
- Receptions: 3
- Targets: 5
- Yards: 42
- AVG: 14.0
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 28
- Receiving First Downs: 1

Game 5:
- Receptions: 3
- Targets: 3
- Yards: 64
- AVG: 21.3
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 44
- Receiving First Downs: 2


We need to take averages across all their stats from all games to find the most likely possible plays. We should also check their teams depth chart just to make sure they are not injured or on IR. And what string they are incase they arent starting.


We need to do this for real live data. not just made up data. we need something that will calculate all of this for us and identify the best ones from the league player rankings in all divisions and caluclates the numbers and averages and identifies trends, patterns, success rates, fail rates, yards, receptions, passing td's etc. literally everything. and if they had one stat that was off or their game numbers are very volital rather than consistant that should be a caution for the player. so it also needs to identify volitility.




Okay, I dont like how it says "Our AI is currently analyzing player performance data. Check back soon for personalized predictions!" I dont like this cause that means it is parsing this every single time a person loads the site. But they only play on sundays, mondays, and thursdays. So there is no point in parsing the data or analyzing every single time. it should do it like at the end of every game day, then it has all the latest stats and can fetch the latest data instantly throughout the week.

Also, please add real game log parsing so we can achieve this.




I just signed up for a "Sportsdataio" trial. lets use them for our data provider. here is my api key

69641481ea3e47728270d996b5132104




I'd like to work on the individual players stat page. We currently have it set up to show their season stats but this is a parlay site. I want to have it so when they view a player its the players picture, name, and other info like position etc. then below that i want it to be a contaier with sliding bars. each one is different. things like

rushing
receptions
receiving Yards
touch Downs
etc. 

the user should be able to slide the bars, so say for example they are sliding the rushing bar. it is between 0-100 yards. they can select the number of yards and it will say the probability percentage of the player acheiving that in their next game based on their stats.

then below the bars we can have their season stats displayed. I think this would be very cool.

This parameter indicates which BettingOutcome records to return in the payload. By default, this endpoint only returns available outcomes, excluding the unlisted bets.

Important Note: the default parameter of available is much faster and provides the best performance. Passing unlisted will return unlisted odds, but these are cached for much longer and may be several minutes old. For best performance, the default parameter is highly recommended.

Possible values include:

available - excludes any betting outcomes that have been removed/unlisted by the respective sportsbook. This is more lightweight and delivers odds much faster than using unlisted.

unlisted - includes the most recently available betting outcome per sportsbook, for each listed market, even those outcomes are expired/unlisted or otherwise unavailable from the respective sportsbook. This is a far heavier payload, and it's cached for much longer than available.
