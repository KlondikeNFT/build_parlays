I want to build a website called "BuildParlays" that is dedicated to showing player stats and outcome likelyhoods to help people find the safest and best likely outcomes to place in their parlays. Currently I want it only NFL based. There should be option to view all nfl teams, view team data and individual player data. basically a website for all team and player stats of the nfl, similar to nfl or espn and other data platforms. Not worried about parlay or likleyhood information yet. just getting a working landing page and real data.

Some Landing page items:
1. teams (menu of all teams)
2. Schedule (calander of all nfl games and times and brodcast locations)
3. Search bar (to search specific players, teams, etc.)






Alright I love it so far. I would like to make some changes. Maybe we can say that it's AI since ai is a trending niche rn. even if its not, we can call it something like an AI Sports calculator or something. It would also be massive I think if make it say something like "BuildParlays has no affiliation with any casino or sports book organizations". that could build lots of trust since people claim many times things are rigged.


Then I would like to remove those large three buttons below the blue that says All teams, schedule, and search. I want to replace that section with a side scrolling menu that says this weeks top players. then in the menu is cards of players from the leagues top players. It should take the ones from the list with the safest average, like no mossing games, and stats with least volitility, then put their safest info in a card like

- Player image
- Player name
- 90+ receiving yards - 60% likely 
- 4+ receptions - 80% likely
etc. 







Yes! that is exactly what i was looking for! Only now we need to build an actual function that calculates those stats and identifies players from the real latest and current data.

It will have to,

- find players leading in stats on rankings.
- identify stat types.
- analyze numbers accross all games of season. 
so for example lets say we have player Travis Hunter. here is just their receiving stats for this season

Game 1:
- Receptions: 6
- Targets: 8
- Yards: 33
- AVG: 5.5
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 10
- Receiving First Downs: 0

Game 2:
- Receptions: 3
- Targets: 6
- Yards: 22
- AVG: 7.3
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 9
- Receiving First Downs: 1

Game 3:
- Receptions: 1
- Targets: 2
- Yards: 21
- AVG: 21.0
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 21
- Receiving First Downs: 1

Game 4:
- Receptions: 3
- Targets: 5
- Yards: 42
- AVG: 14.0
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 28
- Receiving First Downs: 1

Game 5:
- Receptions: 3
- Targets: 3
- Yards: 64
- AVG: 21.3
- TD: 0
- Longest Reception: 44
- Receiving First Downs: 2


We need to take averages across all their stats from all games to find the most likely possible plays. We should also check their teams depth chart just to make sure they are not injured or on IR. And what string they are incase they arent starting.


We need to do this for real live data. not just made up data. we need something that will calculate all of this for us and identify the best ones from the league player rankings in all divisions and caluclates the numbers and averages and identifies trends, patterns, success rates, fail rates, yards, receptions, passing td's etc. literally everything. and if they had one stat that was off or their game numbers are very volital rather than consistant that should be a caution for the player. so it also needs to identify volitility.




Okay, I dont like how it says "Our AI is currently analyzing player performance data. Check back soon for personalized predictions!" I dont like this cause that means it is parsing this every single time a person loads the site. But they only play on sundays, mondays, and thursdays. So there is no point in parsing the data or analyzing every single time. it should do it like at the end of every game day, then it has all the latest stats and can fetch the latest data instantly throughout the week.

Also, please add real game log parsing so we can achieve this.




I just signed up for a "Sportsdataio" trial. lets use them for our data provider. here is my api key

69641481ea3e47728270d996b5132104




I'd like to work on the individual players stat page. We currently have it set up to show their season stats but this is a parlay site. I want to have it so when they view a player its the players picture, name, and other info like position etc. then below that i want it to be a contaier with sliding bars. each one is different. things like

rushing
receptions
receiving Yards
touch Downs
etc. 

the user should be able to slide the bars, so say for example they are sliding the rushing bar. it is between 0-100 yards. they can select the number of yards and it will say the probability percentage of the player acheiving that in their next game based on their stats.

then below the bars we can have their season stats displayed. I think this would be very cool.




So I notice every time we use the site we are making api calls. I would like to create a mock db with a player called mock and give themmock stats so that while I build and work on the site in local host I can just search the player mock and v iew them so I can work on functions and see everything and test everything without making calls etc. So I would like you to do this and also for this to work we will need to make our search bar functional so that it can actually search things such as players.






Perfect thank you. Now I was thinking about the volatility score. What if we removed that. Then instead added a volitility banner or caption for each of the stats available for that player with the silding bars. So it could do the volatility identification and scoring for each individual stat type rather than one total score which says less. so for example it could do it for passing yards accross all games played this season.





I'd like to do some SEO work to start making my site appear at the top of search results. So of course my main domain is BuildParlays.com here are my other domains I own that I have redirrected directly to my site.

1parlay.com

buildparlay.com
buildparlays.com
cashparlay.com
collegeparlays.com
makeparalys.com
parlaylegs.com
parlayodd.com
textparlay.com
textparlays.com

Can you help me optimize my site for SEO and to help increase results for people searching parlays and etc. on the internet? Of course naturally I would love to make it so that it always is a top result for almost all searches related to sports betting and parlays hahaha

This parameter indicates which BettingOutcome records to return in the payload. By default, this endpoint only returns available outcomes, excluding the unlisted bets.

Important Note: the default parameter of available is much faster and provides the best performance. Passing unlisted will return unlisted odds, but these are cached for much longer and may be several minutes old. For best performance, the default parameter is highly recommended.

Possible values include:

available - excludes any betting outcomes that have been removed/unlisted by the respective sportsbook. This is more lightweight and delivers odds much faster than using unlisted.

unlisted - includes the most recently available betting outcome per sportsbook, for each listed market, even those outcomes are expired/unlisted or otherwise unavailable from the respective sportsbook. This is a far heavier payload, and it's cached for much longer than available.

This parameter indicates which BettingOutcome records to return in the payload. By default, this endpoint only returns available outcomes, excluding the unlisted bets.

Important Note: the default parameter of available is much faster and provides the best performance. Passing unlisted will return unlisted odds, but these are cached for much longer and may be several minutes old. For best performance, the default parameter is highly recommended.

Possible values include:

available - excludes any betting outcomes that have been removed/unlisted by the respective sportsbook. This is more lightweight and delivers odds much faster than using unlisted.

unlisted - includes the most recently available betting outcome per sportsbook, for each listed market, even those outcomes are expired/unlisted or otherwise unavailable from the respective sportsbook. This is a far heavier payload, and it's cached for much longer than available.

Step 1 : Copy Your Pixel Script.
Copy your unique OTTO Pixel script provided.

<script nowprocket nitro-exclude type="text/javascript" id="sa-dynamic-optimization" data-uuid="dbb69606-524e-4692-9374-e1d7a2f1ad16" src="data:text/javascript;base64,dmFyIHNjcmlwdCA9IGRvY3VtZW50LmNyZWF0ZUVsZW1lbnQoInNjcmlwdCIpO3NjcmlwdC5zZXRBdHRyaWJ1dGUoIm5vd3Byb2NrZXQiLCAiIik7c2NyaXB0LnNldEF0dHJpYnV0ZSgibml0cm8tZXhjbHVkZSIsICIiKTtzY3JpcHQuc3JjID0gImh0dHBzOi8vZGFzaGJvYXJkLnNlYXJjaGF0bGFzLmNvbS9zY3JpcHRzL2R5bmFtaWNfb3B0aW1pemF0aW9uLmpzIjtzY3JpcHQuZGF0YXNldC51dWlkID0gImRiYjY5NjA2LTUyNGUtNDY5Mi05Mzc0LWUxZDdhMmYxYWQxNiI7c2NyaXB0LmlkID0gInNhLWR5bmFtaWMtb3B0aW1pemF0aW9uLWxvYWRlciI7ZG9jdW1lbnQuaGVhZC5hcHBlbmRDaGlsZChzY3JpcHQpOw=="></script>

Step 2: Add Script to Your Website
Paste the script you copied into the section of your website. This should be placed inside the <head> tag.



do we have the right info?

api key = 647158ea5a2d902fcfeeab62e5022c8f
Account ID: 160-817

Let's verify a few key points:
Check your API key:
- Confirm you're using the correct API key from Search Atlas Settings
- Ensure you have a Pro or Enterprise subscription for API access
- Verify the X-API-Key header is properly formatted
Verify the endpoint URL:
- Confirm you're hitting the correct Search Atlas API endpoint
- Check that the UUID in your request matches your project UUID exactly


















Step 1: Get Your OTTO Pixel Script
Go to Search Atlas Dashboard → OTTO & Audit → All Sites
Select your project and click Copy Code to get your unique script


That is this...

<script nowprocket nitro-exclude type="text/javascript" id="sa-dynamic-optimization" data-uuid="dbb69606-524e-4692-9374-e1d7a2f1ad16" src="data:text/javascript;base64,dmFyIHNjcmlwdCA9IGRvY3VtZW50LmNyZWF0ZUVsZW1lbnQoInNjcmlwdCIpO3NjcmlwdC5zZXRBdHRyaWJ1dGUoIm5vd3Byb2NrZXQiLCAiIik7c2NyaXB0LnNldEF0dHJpYnV0ZSgibml0cm8tZXhjbHVkZSIsICIiKTtzY3JpcHQuc3JjID0gImh0dHBzOi8vZGFzaGJvYXJkLnNlYXJjaGF0bGFzLmNvbS9zY3JpcHRzL2R5bmFtaWNfb3B0aW1pemF0aW9uLmpzIjtzY3JpcHQuZGF0YXNldC51dWlkID0gImRiYjY5NjA2LTUyNGUtNDY5Mi05Mzc0LWUxZDdhMmYxYWQxNiI7c2NyaXB0LmlkID0gInNhLWR5bmFtaWMtb3B0aW1pemF0aW9uLWxvYWRlciI7ZG9jdW1lbnQuaGVhZC5hcHBlbmRDaGlsZChzY3JpcHQpOw=="></script>



Step 2: Create OTTO Component:

// components/OTTOPixel.tsx
'use client';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function OTTOPixel() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Paste your OTTO script here (replace with actual script from dashboard)
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.innerHTML = `
      (function(w, d, s, o, f, js, fjs) {
        w['OTTOObject'] = o; w[o] = w[o] || function() {
          (w[o].q = w[o].q || []).push(arguments)
        }, w[o].l = 1 * new Date();
        js = d.createElement(s), fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
        js.async = 1; js.src = f;
        fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
      })(window, document, 'script', 'OTTO', 'YOUR_SCRIPT_URL');
      OTTO('init', 'YOUR_UUID_HERE');
    `;
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  }, []);

  return null;
}



Step 3: Add to Root Layout:

// app/layout.tsx
import OTTOPixel from '@/components/OTTOPixel';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <OTTOPixel />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}



Step 4: Deploy and Verify
Commit changes to GitHub
Vercel auto-deploys
Go to OTTO dashboard → click Run Diagnostic Scan
Confirm "OTTO Pixel was Installed Correctly" message
Replace YOUR_SCRIPT_URL and YOUR_UUID_HERE with actual values from your copied script.

Understanding NFL Betting Basics
NFL betting can seem complex, but understanding the basics is crucial for making informed decisions. Key concepts include point spreads, moneylines, and over/under totals, which form the foundation of most betting strategies.
